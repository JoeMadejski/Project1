		<p>I am currently a rising senior at the University of Rochester. I am pursing a B.A in computer science. While pursing my degree at the U of R, I work at Starbucks in Wilson Commons as a student supervisor. In High School, I did an internship with a program previously named ScriptEd now known as Code Now. Code Now is where I gained my interest in programming. </p>
